# IAJES Website Revamp

This repository documents the in-progress redesign of the website for **IAJES – International Association of Jesuit Engineering and Sciences Schools**.  

This work is part of my **Senior Design Project**, where I lead the UX, visual design, and proposed layout system for the site.

> 🌐 IAJES unites Jesuit engineering and science schools around the world to collaborate on education, research, and meaningful global impact.

## 🌍 Project Overview

The goal of the IAJES website redesign is to create a modern, structured, and mission-aligned digital presence for an international network of engineering and science institutions.

The revamped site aims to:

- Clearly communicate **who IAJES is** and their global mission  
- Highlight **projects, initiatives, and network impact**  
- Showcase **member institutions**  
- Share updates about **events, conferences, and collaborations**  
- Provide a more intuitive navigation experience  
- Establish a unified, modern brand identity  

This repository currently focuses on the **Design Phase**:  
wireframes → prototypes → branding → design system.  
Implementation will begin once design is finalized.

## 🎯 Project Objectives

- Improve **information architecture** to reduce cognitive load
- Create a **consistent, modern design system** (colors, components, grids)
- Build responsive design for desktop + mobile
- Build a user-centered website for students, faculty, and global partners
- Strengthen IAJES’ digital identity with upgraded visuals and messaging

## 🧠 Design Process

The redesign follows a structured, human-centered workflow:

### 1. **Discovery**
- Reviewed existing IAJES website + materials  
- Identified key user groups (students, faculty, administrators, partners)  
- Mapped content that required clearer structure and hierarchy  
- Gathered expectations from the Senior Design team  

### 2. **Information Architecture**
- Reorganized the entire site into intuitive sections:
  - Home  
  - About  
  - Network / Members  
  - Projects & Initiatives  
  - Events  
  - Resources  
  - Contact  
- Prioritized content that needs immediate visibility  

### 3. **Wireframing**
- Built low & mid-fidelity wireframes in Figma  
- Focused on layout, hierarchy, and flow  
- Iterated based on team feedback  

### 4. **Branding & Visual Identity (In Progress)**
- Developing color palette  
- Selecting typography aligned with Jesuit values  
- Defining spacing and layout rules  
- Designing core components (buttons, navbars, cards)  

### 5. **Prototyping (In Progress)**
- Created interactive mid-fidelity prototype  
- Demonstrates homepage, navigation, structure, and layout  
- Will evolve into final UI as branding finalizes  

### 6. **Implementation (Upcoming)**
- Convert final UI into responsive HTML/CSS/JS  
- Prepare assets & guidelines for developers
